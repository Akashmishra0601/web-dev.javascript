    "Node.js allows us to write JavaScript outside of the browser.


Node.js , Deno.js:
    
    Node.js and Deno are both JavaScript runtime environments that allow developers to run JavaScript code outside of the browser. However, they have some differences:

    Node.js: Node.js is a runtime environment for executing JavaScript code server-side. It uses the V8 JavaScript engine, the same engine used by Google Chrome, to execute JavaScript code. Node.js provides various built-in modules and a vast ecosystem of third-party modules through npm (Node Package Manager). It is widely used for building scalable network applications and server-side applications.

    Deno: Deno is a secure runtime for JavaScript and TypeScript built with Rust and maintained by some of the creators of Node.js. It aims to provide a more secure and modern alternative to Node.js. Deno comes with built-in support for TypeScript, a standard library, and a set of command-line tools. It emphasizes security, offering features such as permissions-based access to the file system and network, and it aims to simplify the development process by providing a single executable without requiring a package manager like npm.

    In summary, both Node.js and Deno allow you to write and run JavaScript code outside of the browser, but they have different design philosophies, features, and approaches to security.
